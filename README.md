## Modzy.NET

Modzy.NET is an unoffical .NET SDK for Modzy. It tries to offer the same features as the official Python SDK in a statically-typed library designed to be used by .NET developers
both in traditional apps and in Jupyter notebooks.

### Building
To build the CLI, clone the repo and run `build` or `./build` in the repository folder. Run `modzy` or `./modzy` to access the CLI.
